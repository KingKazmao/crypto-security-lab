Back in november of 2020, CAPCOM warned a ransomware attack might have compromised gamers personal information, up to 350,000 were affected, the third party used ransomware which is a malicious software that threatens to block a victims 
access to their own records unless paid off, (esentially giving you a pay wall to log in or get information) the attackers scrambled some of the ddata on capcoms servers, making it 
impossible to view or amend and destroyed some files outright
The ragnar locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption inolved, Capcom said. 

Eventually capcom was able to confirm only 9 peoples personal info was definitely compromised, all current or former employees.
but up to 350k customers, business partners, and other empolyees might have been affected.

The company eventually let out a deep apology for all those affected. All online transactions were handled by a third party, and capcom does not maintain any such information internally. Noone credit card was at risk. 
Using data protection watch dogs, they let all fans it was ok to use their services again.
